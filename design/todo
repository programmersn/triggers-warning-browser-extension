- disable sharingan : return tiemoutID in CustomEvent for every segment injected. Store timeoutIDs in an array in contentScriptNetflixPlaybackController.js.

- Find a way to select the most relevant pair of timestamps (startTime, endTime) for a given segment, amongst all the slightly different pairs
that users might have collaboralitviely shared.

- Reinitialize the state of the popup to sharingan-available whenever the page reloads (to be done
probably in popup.js)
