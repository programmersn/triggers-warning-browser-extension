- disable sharingan : return tiemoutID in CustomEvent for every segment injected. Store timeoutIDs in an array in contentScriptNetflixPlaybackController.js.

- Find a way to select the most relevant pair of timestamps (startTime, endTime) for a given segment, amongst all the slightly different pairs
that users might have collaboralitviely shared.

- Reinitialize the state of the popup to sharingan-available whenever the page reloads (to be done
probably in popup.js)

- Currently, getContentId() method is triggered in content script every time the popup opens. 
Improve that by fetching the contentId from contentMetadata so that subsequent calls to the method won't be needed.

- When a user submits a sensitive segment without indicating a sensitive category, displays an error message on popup-report-segment.html page

- Extract only the useful part in Netflix URLS lying before '?trackId' token, and only make use of that part across the whole codebase 
for simplicity and uniformity sake

- Inject a newly reported graphic segment into the playback locally.

- If sharingan is already enabled, when options are set or updated, inject segments pertaining to the new categories user set.
